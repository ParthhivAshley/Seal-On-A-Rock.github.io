## Markdown Learning Adventures

wtf
is this
shit,

pranab says setext heading do be pointless

## Code blocks, quite useful for my intentions
    pain
    this is a code block
    needs minimum four space indentation
    dont use says pranab because dum
    but the ``` system is easier

```C()
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(){
    int num = 10;
    printf("Goodbye World %d", num);
  }
```
`inline code block with `` `
